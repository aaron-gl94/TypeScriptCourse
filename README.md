## 01-BasicTypes

We need to create a Vite project with Vanilla-TypeScript, let's write in the console:

```console
$ npm create vite
```

Set the project name as: _**'01-typescript-intro'**_, next step we choose the _"Vanilla"_ option and then select _"TypeScript"_. Also, we need to move into to the project folder and install all dependencies from the scaffolding created by Vite and, finally we have to run the solution to start working with Vite compiler and TypeScript together.


```console
$ cd 01-typescript-intro
```
```console
$ npm install
```
```console
$ npm run dev
```
